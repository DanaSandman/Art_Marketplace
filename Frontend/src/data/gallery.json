Through this continued series of tickets, old packets and mantlepiece finds, the artist draws into their worn days, highlighting a time when they were handled, a place where they were used, and a memory of how they were once important. Her technique in exacting these ‘receipts’ to their life-like form brings new awareness of their handled nature and beauty into the once overlooked. The photorealistic nature of these drawings take up to 60 hours per piece.",

Rich with detail, Rashid’s paintings, drawings, and sculptures reference colonialism, empire, and westward expansion in the Americas during the 18th century, remixing global players – African, European, and indigenous peoples – in a process of storytelling and mythmaking. By reworking the historic projects of colonization, war, and the making of nation-states, Rashid creates alternate narratives, scripting a different past for human history – one that intersects with the present and forecasts new futures.

I’m a graduate of the University of Southern California, and I use portrait photography as my primary medium through which to capture the essence of a people and their individual characteristics. In my most recent collection, Gifted, I photograph creative and ingenious Black men in their most natural, unadulterated states and environments. The men photographed are a range of artists, musicians, actors, businessmen, filmmakers, etc, who have garnered recognition and accolades for their work. Most importantly, these men have transcended and combated through their craft, the negative stereotypes and skewed representations of Black men that circulate in society as a result of a very befouled, calamitous and tainted history of African people in the Americas. The purpose of this collection is to honor the creative genius and profound contribution that these men have made to their communities and society as a whole. I firmly believe the visual documentation and exposure of these artists is a display of the strength and beauty of Black men to create and inspire tremendous work despite a period in history of emasculation and social denigration. Gifted, is dedicated to my father, who continues to be the driving influence for my work. His prominent role as a strong, loving and dedicated father helped to shape my perspective of Black men from an early age. Through his example, I came to realize the strength, ingenuity, elegance, and excellence inherent in these men and it is through this lens I efficaciously reveal a very shrouded but profound truth.

All stages of the process, from making to naming, are equally important. There’s a different story for each stage though I’m driven by values of simplicity and imperfection. I work mainly with abstractions, digitally drawn or painted by hand on the floor. I paint from all sides and angles and inhabit the space of the painting. I go where the painting and brush takes me. It is such a meditative state, and once I immerse myself in my work, I lose myself to it and let go. My digital and painted works are linked together as the pieces often start as digital sketches and then get painted on linen. It is like working backwards, going from something simple and precise to something organic and imperfect.” - Sepideh Ilsley EDUCATION 2013, Umeå University, Stockholm, Sweden, Digital Images 2008, Berghs school of communication, Stockholm, Sweden, Art Direction 2001-2004, Södertörns University, Stockholm, Sweden, Media and communication 2000-2001, Berghs school of communication, Stockholm, Sweden, Graphic design and Illustration",

      "description": "Bella McGoldrick is an Australian artist, currently living in New York City. Her realism works on paper are made up of dynamic and curated subject matter, usually floating in the white space, reflecting used and pre-adored objects. She uses color pencils to create these works, often taking the artist 60 hours per piece, that can at first appear photographic. By playing with scale and composition, these items to which McGoldrick finnesses over enable her subjects to breath on the walls to which they’re hung. A depth is created where there was just white space, and the stories of these previously loved and handled objects leave the viewer to question “Whom did they belong to?”",
